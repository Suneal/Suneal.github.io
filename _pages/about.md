I am a Security and Privacy Research Scientist at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center. I received my Ph.D. from William & Mary. My research interests include IoT security, privacy, software security, and NLP. I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Information Technology from St. Xavierâ€™s College, Nepal.

I enjoy philosophizing, hiking, listening to indie/rock music, and trying out lesser known cuisines! ðŸ˜‹
